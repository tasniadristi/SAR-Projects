# ðŸŒŠ Cyclone Amphan Flood Assessment (2020) â€“ Sentinel-1 SAR

This project maps the **flood impact of Cyclone Amphan (May 2020)** in Bangladeshâ€™s coastal districts using **Sentinel-1 SAR data** and **Google Earth Engine (GEE)**. SAR imagery penetrates clouds, allowing near real-time disaster monitoring during cyclones.

## Study Area
- **Districts:** Satkhira, Khulna, and surrounding coastal areas  
- **Country:** Bangladesh  

## Study Period
- **Pre-event:** May 5â€“15, 2020  
- **Post-event:** May 21â€“31, 2020  

---

## Objectives
1. Map flood-affected areas using pre- and post-event SAR imagery.  
2. Quantify flood extent, exposed population, and affected cropland.  
3. Demonstrate how SAR-based analysis supports disaster preparedness and recovery planning.  

---

## Key Findings
- **Flooded area:** 165,227 hectares  
- **Exposed population:** 362,450 people  
- **Affected cropland:** 20,049 hectares

## Methodology
1. **Data Acquisition:** Sentinel-1 SAR (VV polarization) via GEE  
2. **Preprocessing:**  
   - Speckle filtering  
   - Radiometric calibration  
   - Terrain correction  
3. **Water Detection:** Thresholding and classification  
4. **Change Detection:** Compare pre- and post-event images  
5. **Impact Assessment:** Overlay flood maps with population and cropland datasets
